DAYSTARTER
Daystarter is a quick small web application that can give any user some quick details that may need to start their day. Weather, traffic and news based on location. Using services that do not require them to log in and being able to utilize free web services & apis. Eventually may add more functionality that can save user logins to get more specific and deatiled information. The project is a based display of understanding how to interact with web services, get data from them and display information to the user. In doing so this also was a good example of how to build a backend route that makes the call to the services in order to secure the api keys associate with the project. Lastly a decent demonstration of Vanilla javascript on handling the data and generating the display units.
